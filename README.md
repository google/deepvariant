## About DeepVariant

redacted

## Support

The Genomics team in Google Brain actively supports DeepVariant and are always
interested in improving the quality of DeepVariant. If you run into an issue, we
recommend you follow one of two approaches to getting the issue resolved.

If you have found a bug in DeepVariant - i.e., the code itself needs to be
fixed - please report the problem on our [Issue
tracker](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues). Make sure to add enough
detail to your report that we can reproduce the problem and fix it. We encourage
including links to snippets of BAM/VCF/etc. files that provoke the bug, if
possible. Depending on the severity of the issue we may patch DeepVariant
immediately with the fix or roll it into the next release.

If you have general questions about DeepVariant usage, please post your question
to [BioStars](https://www.biostars.org/), adding the tag 'deepvariant'. We
monitor [BioStars posts tagged with
DeepVariant](https://www.biostars.org/t/deepvariant/) and will respond as needed
there.
