description: "In this post, we demonstrate how using ML models to classify medical imaging data can be used to improve GWAS. We describe how models can be trained for phenotypes to generate trait predictions, how these predictions are used to identify novel genetic associations, and that the novel associations discovered improve PRS accuracy."
