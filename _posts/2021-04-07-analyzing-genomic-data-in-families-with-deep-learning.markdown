description: "This post dives into DeepTrio, which can jointly analyze a mother-father-child trio of samples. We discuss how we represent the trio data and how DeepTrio is trained. We give accuracy benchmarks for DeepTrio, showing that it has higher accuracy than single sample calling, especially at low sequence depths."
