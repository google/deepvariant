description: "In this post, we discuss the methods development that contributed to building and using Pangenome references in the paper “A draft human pangenome reference”. We outline the rationale for using pangenomes. We discuss how accuracy in the sequences which compose Pangenomes is essential, and how DeepConsensus can be used to improve sequence for pangenomes and DeepVariant was adapted to polish pangenome assemblies. We discuss methods that map sequences to pangenomes to achieve higher accuracy."
