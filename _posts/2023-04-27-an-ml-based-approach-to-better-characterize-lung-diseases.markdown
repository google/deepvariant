description: "In this post, we highlight a new machine-learning-based phenotyping approach published in Nature Genetics. COPD liability scores from our deep learning model improve genetic association discovery and risk prediction. We trained our model using high dimensional lung function data and noisy medical record labels obtained from self-reporting and hospital diagnostic codes, and demonstrated that our method generalizes to diseases that lack expert-defined annotations."
