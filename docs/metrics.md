Starting from v1.4.0, users don't need to phase the BAMs first, and only need
to run DeepVariant once.

## Inspect outputs that produced the metrics above

The DeepVariant VCFs, gVCFs, and hap.py evaluation outputs are available at:

```
gs://deepvariant/case-study-outputs
```

You can also inspect them in a web browser here:
https://42basepairs.com/browse/gs/deepvariant/case-study-outputs

## How to reproduce the metrics on this page

For simplicity and consistency, we report runtime with a
[CPU instance with 64 CPUs](deepvariant-details.md#command-for-a-cpu-only-machine-on-google-cloud-platform)
This is NOT the fastest or cheapest configuration.

Use `gcloud compute ssh` to log in to the newly created instance.

Download and run any of the following case study scripts:

```
# Get the script.
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/deepvariant/r1.5/scripts/inference_deepvariant.sh

# WGS
bash inference_deepvariant.sh --model_preset WGS

# WES
bash inference_deepvariant.sh --model_preset WES

# PacBio
bash inference_deepvariant.sh --model_preset PACBIO

# ONT_R104
bash inference_deepvariant.sh --model_preset ONT_R104

# Hybrid
bash inference_deepvariant.sh --model_preset HYBRID_PACBIO_ILLUMINA
```

Runtime metrics are taken from the resulting log after each stage of
DeepVariant. The runtime numbers reported above are the average of 5 runs each.
The accuracy metrics come from the hap.py summary.csv output file.
The runs are deterministic so all 5 runs produced the same output.
