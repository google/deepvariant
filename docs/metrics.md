```bash
GCP instance type: n2-standard-96
CPUs: 96-core (vCPU)
Memory: 384GiB
GPUs: 0
```

## PacBio (HiFi)

### Updated dataset

We have updated the PacBio test data from HG003 Sequel-II to
latest Revio with SPRQ chemistry data to showcase performance on the updated
platform and chemistry. The numbers reported here are generated using the bam
that can be found in:

```bash
gs://deepvariant/pacbio-case-study-testdata/HG003.SPRQ.pacbio.GRCh38.nov2024.bam
```

Which is also available through [here](https://downloads.pacbcloud.com/public/revio/2024Q4/WGS/GIAB_trio/HG003/analysis/GRCh38.m84039_241002_000337_s3.hifi_reads.bc2020.bam).

### Runtime

to run DeepVariant once.

## Inspect outputs that produced the metrics above

The DeepVariant VCFs, gVCFs, and hap.py evaluation outputs are available at:

```
gs://deepvariant/case-study-outputs
```

You can also inspect them in a web browser here:
https://42basepairs.com/browse/gs/deepvariant/case-study-outputs

## How to reproduce the metrics on this page

For simplicity and consistency, we report runtime with a
[CPU instance with 96 CPUs](deepvariant-details.md#command-for-a-cpu-only-machine-on-google-cloud-platform)
This is NOT the fastest or cheapest configuration.

Use `gcloud compute ssh` to log in to the newly created instance.

Download and run any of the following case study scripts:

```
# Get the script.
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/deepvariant/r1.9/scripts/inference_deepvariant.sh

# WGS
bash inference_deepvariant.sh --model_preset WGS

# WES
bash inference_deepvariant.sh --model_preset WES

# PacBio
bash inference_deepvariant.sh --model_preset PACBIO

# ONT_R104
bash inference_deepvariant.sh --model_preset ONT_R104

# Hybrid
bash inference_deepvariant.sh --model_preset HYBRID_PACBIO_ILLUMINA
```

Runtime metrics are taken from the resulting log after each stage of
DeepVariant. The runtime numbers reported above are the average of 5 runs each.
The accuracy metrics come from the hap.py summary.csv output file.
The runs are deterministic so all 5 runs produced the same output.
