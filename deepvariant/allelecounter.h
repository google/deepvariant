// Workhorse class to compute AlleleCounts over an interval on the genome.

// AlleleCounter works roughly as follows:
//
// AlleleCounter counter = AlleleCounter(ref, interval)
//
// // Add reads that overlap our interval
// for ( read : reads_that_overlap_interval ) {
//   counter.Add(read)
//
// // Tell the counter that we are done adding reads
// counter.Finalize()
// vector<AlleleCount> counter.Counts()
//
// The returned vector of AlleleCounts has an AlleleCount for every position in
// the interval.  Each AlleleCount contains a position, the reference base at
// that position, and a repeated field of Allele protos which contain the bases,
// type, and counts of the alleles. Each observed allele comes from the
// alignment of a read at that position in the genome.  For example, if we have:
//
//   pos:  0123
//   ref:  ACGT
//   read:  CG
//
// We could produce AlleleCounts with 0 observed alleles at position 0, one C
// at position 1, one G at position 2, and no alleles at position 3.
//
// This becomes more complex when insertion and deletion alleles occur, so that
// you have:
//
//   pos:  0123
//   ref:  ACGT
//   read:  C-T
//
// Would actually produce an allele CG deletion at position 1, indicating that
// the reference base was C and that a G base was deleted. No allele count would
// occur at G (after all it was never observed), and there would be 1 T at
// position 3.  The AlleleCount proto and associated other protos provide
// additional details.
//
// The AlleleCount's generated by adding each read simply sum up independently
// with multiple reads, which is a very attractive property of the AlleleCount
// representation.
//
// Note that this code can diverge from the left-alignment requirement of VCF /
// variant protos when the input read cigars are themselves not  left aligned.
// For example, suppose we have:
//
// ref:    TAAAC
// sample: TAAC
//
// Ideally an aligner would place the DELETION cigar elements for any read
// covering this site to the left-most position:
//
// ref:    TAAAC
// read1:  T-AAC [cigar = 1M1D3M, ideal]
// read2:  TA-AC [cigar = 2M1D2M, pretty far from ideal, but equivalent]
//
// This code doesn't try to do anything clever by left-aligning CIGAR elements
// in order to fix this problem. This is largely ok because (1) the standard
// aligner (BWA) does in fact do consistent left alignment and (2) we anticipate
// feeding this AlleleCounter reads that have been assembled into a consistent
// alignment across all of the reads in a way that is impossible for a read-by-
// read aligner to do. So beware with the aligner you use, unless you've cleaned
// up the reads in some way (left aligning the cigars or just doing assembly).
//
// It is ok to send reads that only partially overlap the interval; the
// AlleleCounter will only add counts from the part that overlap the interval.
//
// This code assumes that the reference genome and the reads have only upper
// case bases. By construction our GenomeReference will not have lower case
// bases. Lower case bases are allowed in read sequences (see
// https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf),
// so it may be worth upper casing the read sequence at some point to make this
// code more robust.
//
// AlleleCounter performs some specialized logic to deal with non-canonical
// bases that might occur in the reference and/or the reads. By canonical we
// mean bases that are one of {A,C,G,T}. The basic constraint is that we will
// not add Allele's that contain non-canonical bases. So if we have a read that
// has (e.g.) an N, we will not produce Allele objects that contain the N. So
// if it doesn't match the reference at a site, it will be skipped as a
// SUBSTITUTION allele, and if it were part of an insertion, that entire
// insertion will be skipped. We do support AlleleCount objects that have a N
// base as its reference base, and those bases get alleles just as a normal base
// would. Downstream processing should look at the reference base of the
// AlleleCounts produced by this code for non-canonical reference bases and
// handle if special handling is needed. Finally, if a read's deletion CIGAR
// spans across part of the reference genome that has an N, the corresponding
// DELETION allele will be dropped.
