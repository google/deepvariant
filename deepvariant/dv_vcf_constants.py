  """Returns a VcfHeader used for writing VCF output.

  This function fills out the FILTER, INFO, FORMAT, and extra header information
  created by the DeepVariant pipeline using consistent fields that DeepVariant
  creates. The `contigs` and `sample_names` fields are unique depending on the
  input data used, so are required inputs.

  Args:
    contigs: list(ContigInfo). The list of contigs on which variants were
      called.
    sample_names: list(str). The list of samples present in the run.
    add_info_candidates: Adds the 'CANDIDATES' info field for debugging
      purposes.
    include_med_dp: boolean. If True, we will include MED_DP.

  Returns:
    A nucleus.genomics.v1.VcfHeader proto with known fixed headers and the given
    samples and contigs populated.
