"""Haplotype-based labeling algorithm for DeepVariant.

This module provides a haplotype-aware labeling algorithm. This is a more
sophisticated approach to labeling that allows for slight representational
differences between candidate and truth variant sets. See:

https://github.com/ga4gh/benchmarking-tools
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/15/270157

for an introduction to the concepts and why this is important.


The module is implemented in two big pieces of functionality:

find_best_matching_haplotypes(candidates, truths) provides an function that
accepts a list of candidate variants and a list of truth variants with known
genotypes and finds an assignment of genotypes for candidates and truth that
results in the same two haplotype sequences in the region. Since the truth
variants have known genotypes, the search there is constrained to those
genotypes and their potential set of false negatives (e.g., if truth is (0, 1)
we may have missed the variant so we consider both (0, 1) and (0, 0)). The
returned value is a HaplotypeMatch object describing the genotype assignments
for candidates and truth.

HaplotypeLabeler implements the variant_labeler.VariantLabeler API by calling
our find_best_matching_haplotypes function to get the HaplotypeMatch objects and
returning variant_labeler.VariantLabel objects for each candidate variant.
