// Performs iterative methylation-aware phasing on a set of reads.
//
// This function assigns haplotype phases to unphased reads based on their
// methylation profiles at informative CpG sites. It uses already-phased reads
// from direct phasing to define the haplotype-specific methylation signatures,
// identifies differentially methylated sites, and votes for each unphased
// read's haplotype assignment by comparing its methylation levels to those
// signatures.
//
// The phasing is done iteratively. In each iteration:
//   1. Reads phased to haplotype 1 and 2 are used to identify informative
//      CpG sites.
//   2. Unphased reads are assigned to the haplotype with more similar
//      methylation patterns.
//   3. The loop terminates when either convergence is reached (no new reads
//      were phased), or a maximum number of iterations is exceeded.
//
// Args:
//   reads_to_phase: Vector of all reads in the region, including phased and
//                   unphased.
//   initial_read_phases: Vector of phase assignments for each read
//                        (0 = unphased).
//   methylated_ref_sites: List of candidate CpG sites used for
//                        methylation-aware phasing.
//   max_iter: Maximum number of phasing iterations to perform.
//
// Returns:
//   A vector of integer phase calls (0, 1, or 2) for each read, same size and
//   order as reads_to_phase.
