// This utility is used to merge phased reads from different shards.
// We can find a consistent phasing if there are reads that overlap multiple
// shards. Please note, that input file must be local, this utility does not
// Google paths.
//
// Usage:
// blaze-bin/learning/genomics/deepvariant/merge_phased_reads_cpp \
// --input_path <Path to sharded tsv file> \
// --output_path <Path to output file> \
// --logtostderr
