// ### Reverse-stranded reads
//
// Mapped reads (reads having a non-null `alignment`) can be aligned to either
// the forward or the reverse strand of their associated reference. Strandedness
// of a mapped read is encoded by `alignment.position.reverseStrand`.
//
// If we consider the reference to be a forward-stranded coordinate space of
// `[0, reference.length)` with `0` as the left-most position and
// `reference.length` as the right-most position, reads are always aligned left
// to right. That is, `alignment.position.position` always refers to the
// left-most reference coordinate and `alignment.cigar` describes the alignment
// of this read to the reference from left to right. All per-base fields such as
// `alignedSequence` and `alignedQuality` share this same left-to-right
// orientation; this is true of reads which are aligned to either strand. For
// reverse-stranded reads, this means that `alignedSequence` is the reverse
// complement of the bases that were originally reported by the sequencing
// machine.
//
// ### Generating a reference-aligned sequence string
//
// When interacting with mapped reads, it's often useful to produce a string
// representing the local alignment of the read to reference. The following
// pseudocode demonstrates one way of doing this:
//
//     out = ""
//     offset = 0
//     for c in read.alignment.cigar {
//       switch c.operation {
//       case "ALIGNMENT_MATCH", "SEQUENCE_MATCH", "SEQUENCE_MISMATCH":
//         out += read.alignedSequence[offset:offset+c.operationLength]
//         offset += c.operationLength
//         break
//       case "CLIP_SOFT", "INSERT":
//         offset += c.operationLength
//         break
//       case "PAD":
//         out += repeat("*", c.operationLength)
//         break
//       case "DELETE":
//         out += repeat("-", c.operationLength)
//         break
//       case "SKIP":
//         out += repeat(" ", c.operationLength)
//         break
//       case "CLIP_HARD":
//         break
//       }
//     }
//     return out
//
// ### Converting to SAM's CIGAR string
//
// The following pseudocode generates a SAM CIGAR string from the
// `cigar` field. Note that this is a lossy conversion
// (`cigar.referenceSequence` is lost).
//
//     cigarMap = {
//       "ALIGNMENT_MATCH": "M",
//       "INSERT": "I",
//       "DELETE": "D",

//       "SEQUENCE_MISMATCH": "X",
//     }
//     cigarStr = ""
//     for c in read.alignment.cigar {
//       cigarStr += c.operationLength + cigarMap[c.operation]
//     }
//     return cigarStr
