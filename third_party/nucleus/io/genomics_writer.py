"""Classes that provide the interface for writing genomics data.

`GenomicsWriter` defines the core API supported by writers, and is subclassed
directly or indirectly (via `DispatchingGenomicsWriter`) for all concrete
implementations.

`TFRecordWriter` is an implementation of the `GenomicsWriter` API for reading
`TFRecord` files. This is usable for all data types when writing data as
serialized protocol buffers.

`DispatchingGenomicsWriter` is an abstract class defined for convenience on top
of `GenomicsWriter` that supports writing to either the native file format or to
`TFRecord` files of the corresponding protocol buffer used to encode data of
that file type. The output format chosen is dependent upon the filename to which
the data are being written.

Concrete implementations for individual file types (e.g. BED, SAM, VCF, etc.)
reside in type-specific modules in this package. A general example of the write
functionality is shown below.

```python
# options is a writer-specific set of options.
options = ...

# records is an iterable of protocol buffers of the specific data type.
records = ...

with GenomicsWriterSubClass(output_path, options) as writer:
  for proto in records:
    writer.write(proto)
```
