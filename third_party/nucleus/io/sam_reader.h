// This class provides methods to iterate through a BAM file or, if indexed,
// to also query() for only read overlapping a specific region on the genome.
//
// Uses the htslib C API for reading NGS reads (BAM, SAM, CRAM etc). For details
// of the API, see:
//
// https://github.com/samtools/htslib/tree/develop/htslib
//
// The objects returned by iterate() or query() are nucleus.genomics.v1.Read
// objects parsed from the SAM/BAM/CRAM records in the file. Currently all
// fields except the extended key/value maps in each BAM fields are parsed.
//

  //
  // reads_path must point to an existing SAM/BAM/CRAM formatted file (text SAM,
  // compressed or uncompressed BAM file, CRAM files in all sorts of flavors).
  //
  // ref_path can be "", in which case the argument is ignored, or must point
  // to an existing FASTA file. If not "" and the reads_path points to a CRAM
  // file, the CRAM_OPT_REFERNECE field will be set to this path so that the
  // CRAM decoder uses ref_path to decode the reference-compressed read
  // sequences in the CRAM file. Because many low-level IO routines (e.g. stat)
  // are currently directly used in the CRAM implementation in htslib, ref_path
  // must be on a local (e.g., POSIX accessible) mount point. File system access
  // provided by htslib plugins (e.g., S3) won't work.
  //

  // CRAI index from file reads_path + '.bai' or reads_path (without the .bam
  // extension) + '.bai'; if the index is not found, attempts to Query will
