  # symbolic links.  Replace it with an invocation of unzip, which can.
  # The lines we replace are
  # with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_path) as zf:

  # file, it will uncompress and run the __main__.py.  This is the trick that
  # bazel uses to make a self-executable zip, see for example
  # https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/558b717e906156477b1c6bd29d049a0fb8e18b27/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/bazel/rules/python/BazelPythonSemantics.java#L193
